#  @brief This file contains the function which is the skeleton of the genertic
#  algorithm

## @brief This function will generate population with size N and mutate for X
#  generations with mutate rate of Z and output the final result
#  @param imageIn PPM file, the target image for the evolution
#  @param numGenerations int, the number of generation for the evolution
#  @param populationSize int, the total number of the population
#  @param mutateRate float, the percent of pixel that will be mutated for the image
#  @return imageOut the image that is most similiar to imageIn
class evolve():
    def evolve_image(imageIn, numGenerations, populationSize, mutateRate):
        imageOut = imageIn
        return imageOut
